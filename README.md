# Computational-Physics

This repository is used to hold my solutions to the problems presented in the second edition of Mark Newman's Computational Physics. I have worked some of these before in school, but am going back through them with newer techniques I have learned.

Not every problem for a chapter will be completed, but I will try and get a reasonable variety from those included.
