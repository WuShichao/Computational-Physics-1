These are the problems for Chapter 2 (pages 9 - 88) of Newman's "Computational Physics". Answers are at the end of the code for each problem.

Problem 1:

A ball is again dropped from a tower of height h with initial velocity zero. Write a program that asks the user to enter the height in meters of the tower and then calculates and prints the time the ball takes until it hits the ground, ignoring air resistance. Use your program to calculate the time for a ball dropped from a 100m high tower. 


Problem 2:

A satellite is to be launched into a circular orbit around the Earth so that it orbits the planet once every T seconds.
a) Show that the altitude h above the Earth's surface that the satellite must have is

![equation](http://www.sciweavers.org/tex2img.php?eq=h%20%3D%20%28%20%5Cfrac%7BGM%20T%5E%7B2%7D%20%7D%7B4%20%5Cpi%20%5E%7B2%7D%20%7D%20%29%5E%7B1%2F3%7D%20-%20R&bc=White&fc=Black&im=jpg&fs=12&ff=arev&edit=0)

where G is Newton's gravitational constant, M is the mass of the Earth, and R is the radius of the Earth.

b) Write a program that asks the user to enter the desired value of T and then calculates and prints out the correct altitude in meters.

c) Use your program to calculate the altitudes of satellites that orbit the Earth once a day (so-called "geosynchronous" orbit), once ever 90 minutes, and once every 45 minutes. What do you conclude from the last of these calculations?

d) Technically a geosynchronous satellite is one that orbits the Earth once per sidereal day, which is 23.93 hours, not 24 hours. Why is this? And how much difference will that make to the altitude of the satellite?
