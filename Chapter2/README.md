These are the problems for Chapter 2 (pages 9 - 88) of Newman's "Computational Physics". Answers are at the end of the code for each problem.

Problem 1:

A ball is again dropped from a tower of height h with initial velocity zero. Write a program that asks the user to enter the height in meters of the tower and then calculates and prints the time the ball takes until it hits the ground, ignoring air resistance. Use your program to calculate the time for a ball dropped from a 100m high tower. 

Problem 2:

A satellite is to be launched into a circular orbit around the Earth so that it orbits the planet once every T seconds.
a) Show that the altitude h above the Earth's surface that the satellite must have is
